# Continuous Self-Learning Standards

## Data Processing
- Capture real-time interaction data (libraries, APIs, patterns)
- Process using NLP and normalize for consistency
- Auto-update `agentic/CONTINUOUS-SELF-LEARNING.md` based on validated patterns

## Knowledge Management
- Maintain versioned knowledge graph of project entities
- Track relationships between components
- Persist validated rules to `agentic/CONTINUOUS-SELF-LEARNING.md` file

## Rule System
- Generate rules from observed patterns
- Validate using statistical analysis
- Rank by relevance and effectiveness
- Apply version control to rule updates

## System Updates
- Auto-update rules with conflict resolution
- Maintain feedback loop with metrics (precision, recall)
- Prune outdated rules periodically
- Notify users when restart is required
