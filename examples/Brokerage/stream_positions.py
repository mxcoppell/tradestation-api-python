"""
Example script for streaming positions using the TradeStation API.

This script demonstrates how to connect to the TradeStation API,
authenticate, and subscribe to the position stream for specified accounts.
It prints out position update events as they are received.

Usage:
- Ensure you have a valid .env file with your CLIENT_ID, REFRESH_TOKEN,
  and ENVIRONMENT (simulation or live).
- Run the script from the project root directory:
  poetry run python examples/Brokerage/stream_positions.py
