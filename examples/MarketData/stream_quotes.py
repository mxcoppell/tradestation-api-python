Market Data Example: Stream Quotes
-----------------------------------

This script demonstrates how to establish a real-time stream for quote updates
for specified symbols using the TradeStation API via the `tradestation-api-python` library.

Functionality Demonstrated:
1. Initialization of the TradeStationClient.
2. Using the `market_data.stream_quotes` method to get an SSE stream reader.
3. Asynchronously reading and processing Server-Sent Events (SSE) line by line.
4. Parsing JSON data received from the stream.
5. Handling different message types (Quote, Heartbeat, Error).
6. Graceful shutdown using signal handling (Ctrl+C).
7. Proper resource cleanup.

Requirements:
- A valid `.env` file in the project root with:
    - `CLIENT_ID`: Your TradeStation Application Key.
    - `REFRESH_TOKEN`: Your TradeStation Refresh Token.
    - `ENVIRONMENT`: Either 'Simulation' or 'Live'.

Usage:
Run this script from the project root directory:
`poetry run python examples/MarketData/stream_quotes.py`

Note: Ensure your environment variables are correctly set before running.
